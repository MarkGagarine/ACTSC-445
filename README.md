# ACTSC-445
This repository contains my final paper from my Quantitative Risk Management course (ACTSC445/845) taken in Summer 2024 with Professor Erik Hints. It explores the axiomatic development and applications of distorted risk measures as an alternative framework to coherence, analyzing their economic interpretations and their role in regulatory arbitrage.
